      <description>What is Pythagorean expectation? Link to heading Pythagorean expectation is a formula that was originally derived by Bill James to be used in baseball. The objective of the formula was to estimate how many wins a team should have won based on the number of runs scored and runs allowed. You can read more about the theorem on Wikipedia and this article that also presents few practical examples. Originally the form of the formula looks like this: $$W \approx \frac{(\text{runs scored}) ^ 2}{(\text{runs scored}) ^ 2 + (\text{runs allowed}) ^ 2}\text{,}$$ where $W$ is the ratio of team&amp;rsquo;s wins or win percentage.</description>
